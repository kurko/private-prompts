## Role

Software engineers design, develop and maintain our core Tremendous systems. This includes everything from our user interfaces to our back-end banking integration. Their responsibilities include designing the technical architecture, writing and reviewing code, debugging issues, ensuring system security and performance, and deploying and monitoring new functionality. They collaborate closely with designers, product managers and the data team.

## Competencies

We level engineers at Tremendous based on the overall impact they're having on the company. While this can take many forms, the following four categories stand out as the most important factors:

### 1. Independence

Since we work remotely and asynchronously, engineers who are consistently able to act independently will move more quickly while shipping high-quality work. Some examples of doing this successfully:

- Breaking down a larger task into smaller, shippable pieces.
- Proactively unblocking yourself when you get stuck.
- Consistently delivering a high quality of work while moving quickly.
- Showing flexibility in the face of whatever a particular project may require of us.

### 2. Solid project-management habits

We have a lean product management organization and no dedicated project managers. This places a lot of the responsibility for project management on our engineers. Some examples of doing this successfully:

- Communicate your status proactively, keeping the product manager and the rest of your team in the loop.
- Call out changes to the project timeline in a timely manner. It's normal for things to change, it's just important to know when that happens.
- Knowing when to ask for more resources or support.
- Collaborating successfully with product managers, designers, and business owners.

### 3. Management of complexity

Our projects vary in complexity: some projects are fairly straightforward; others require reasoning about very complex systems. An engineer's ability to elegantly navigate and, whenever possible, simplify these complexities directly correlates with their potential to make significant contributions to our team.

Handling complex projects successfully can take many different forms:

- Handling deep technical issues, for example when optimizing a slow SQL query or tracking down an obscure issue in Rails.
- Modeling a complex domain of our business, for example tracking the movement of money in virtual accounts.
- Coming up with novel approaches or introducing new tools to resolve a problem (for example, to handle vendor rate limits).
- Doing all this while keeping a good pace to maintain project momentum.

### 4. Leverage for the rest of the team

More senior engineers don't manage other engineers, but they can still have impact that goes way beyond their own code. Some examples:

- Providing insightful pull request reviews.
- Helping to define the architecture for larger projects.
- Unblocking others when they are stuck with a particularly difficult technical problem.
- Proactively suggesting improvements to our tooling or processes.
- Writing or updating important and useful documentation.
- Using your deep understanding of our business context by:
    - sharing it with other engineers to unblock their work
    - and making sure our technical solutions match the business need.

## Levels

### No external titles

We only use the leveling described here internally and do not have separate external-facing titles in the product organization. For our team, that means _everybody is a Senior Software Engineer._

### Caveats

**Different ways to reach the top**

There is no one way to reach a "P6" level, for example. Some engineers will distinguish themselves by shipping particularly hairy projects reliably. Others might stand out by how consistently they help unblock other people's work. Yet others might play more of a leadership role in setting standards across the team. Different engineers on our team have different strengths, and that makes us stronger as a team overall.

# P3

**Independence**
Works with their engineering manager or more senior engineers to break projects into smaller, shippable tasks.

When facing a challenging bug or complex task will quickly reach out to a senior engineer to pair, or ask in their team's Slack channel for help.

Submits PRs that initially require significant feedback, but then successfully incorporates all suggestions to produce quality code.

**Project management**
Needs occasional nudges from the EM or PM to communicate updates in Slack and to keep Asana up to date. May miss when the scope of work requires changes to the project timeline. They might continue working on tasks without informing the team about delays caused by unexpected complexities or issues. They often ask PMs or designers for clarification or assistance to fully understand project specifications and how to implement them effectively.

**Complexity**
Tackles simple changes by themselves but only tackles more complex projects as part of a team with more senior help. Turns to their EM or more senior colleagues for guidance when dealing with more complex technical challenges. They often seek help to understand our business domain and how their changes will affect our business processes.

**Leverage**
Participates in code reviews by acknowledging well-written code, makes small suggestions for improvement, or asks questions with the intention of learning. Pairs with more senior engineers to gain context and asks questions about their approach to particular problems. Often, asking questions can push other engineers to articulate their decisions and interrogate their work, improving the quality of their code.


# P4

**Independence**
Independently plans the implementation of a minor feature, outlining small, shippable tasks. But seeks guidance when breaking down a larger project. Independently researches solutions when blocked and will then reach out for help from experts when that does not solve their issue. Mostly submits PRs that do not require significant feedback, and is able to incorporate the feedback on most PRs quickly, usually maintaining a fast pace.

**Project management**
Usually communicates updates proactively by keeping Asana up to date and providing proactive status updates through Slack, team meetings and 1:1s. Will sometimes see issues that will lead to changes in the project timeline, but may still need help identifying and addressing all such issues. For example, they might flag a delay caused by additional feature requests but miss unexpected hidden complexity. Collaborates with product managers and designers to clarify requirements, ensuring alignment and addressing any ambiguities early in the project.

**Complexity**
Can tackle medium complexity projects independently and contributes significantly to more complex projects. Can independently find their way through many technical challenges and knows which colleagues to turn to when facing an issue that requires more specialized knowledge. Is familiar with the parts of our business domain they've been exposed to previously but still needs help with more complex aspects or less familiar domains.

**Leverage**
Provides code reviews and contributes both technical, domain-specific, product, and business context to reviews. Writes clean and readable code, and documents projects in Notion / Asana, so that others can work with their code and they don't become a bottleneck because of knowledge silos.


# P5

**Independence**
Plans the implementation of larger features, breaking them down into parts that may be implemented by other engineers. Consistently unblocks self even on complex tasks by using their technical knowledge and research skills. Submits PRs with well-architected and tested code consistently, with only minor suggestions from reviewers, allowing them to move quickly even on more complex tasks.

**Project management**
Consistently maintains regular communication with the team and PMs, sharing updates without needing prompts and ensuring everyone is aligned on project progress. Quickly identifies and communicates delays caused by unexpected technical challenges, allowing the team to reallocate resources or adjust deadlines. Works directly and proactively with PMs and designers, calling out issues and opportunities. They engage in discussions about potential improvements or risks, actively contributing to project planning and decision-making processes.

**Complexity**
Can oversee the implementation of a more complex project, defining the architecture, breaking down the complexity and mentoring more junior team members during implementation. Has deep technical knowledge that helps them unblock both their own and others' work. Starts to develop specialization: "an expert on x" Has a deep understanding of the business domain touched by their team. Can understand how proposed changes create new edge cases. Can debug complex issues caused by the interaction of multiple unrelated product requirements.

**Leverage**
Participates in architecture conversations, does code reviews on complex PRs, and helps to unblock others where necessary. Works cross-collaboratively with folks across the product org and wider business, provides them with technical insights and context, and empowers them to make decisions within their functions.


# P6

**Independence**
Architects major new features and breaks those projects down into detailed tasks for different components that can be implemented by other team members. Uses their deep product and technical knowledge to unblock themselves and others even on the most difficult bugs or architectural decisions. Submits PRs that set the quality bar for the work delivered across the team while maintaining a good pace, serving as a model for rapid yet reliable development.

**Project management**
They not only share their own updates regularly but also encourage and coordinate communication among team members to ensure everyone stays informed. Monitors the overall project status, identifies hidden complexity and dependencies that might cause delays, and communicates these promptly. Takes initiative to collaborate with PMs, designers and business owners to address challenges and identify potential improvements in the project scope.

**Complexity**
Handles and leads projects of even the largest complexity while guiding multiple engineers of different seniority. Has become one of the recognized experts on the team by developing deep technical knowledge that can help unblock work where others have failed. Has an encyclopedic understanding of the different business requirements touching their work, allowing them to design systems that robustly handle the interaction of multiple, sometimes competing requirements.

**Leverage**
Thinks beyond their immediate team and advocates for or implements processes or tools that would benefit the whole engineering team. Their impact extends beyond their own work and is measured by the success of the team around them as well as themselves. Provides support through their unique experience and knowledge on the team.
